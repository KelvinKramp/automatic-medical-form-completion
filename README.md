Two files:
1) Jupyter Notebook version:  
2) Google colab version of 1). Note: Connection between google colab and your computer or electronic health record database is not verified for communicating privacy information. So don't use this file to make medical forms for real patients. 
Rather download version 1) on a save computer within your workenvironment and run the script or work in directly in Python.
